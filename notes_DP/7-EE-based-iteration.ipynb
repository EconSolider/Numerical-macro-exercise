    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In lectures 2 and 3, we studied two fundamental methods of solving dynamic programming problems: **value function iteration** and **policy function iteration**. These methods, as value function-based approaches, have the advantage of generality, making them flexible for various discrete and continuous models. However, their disadvantages include long computation times and significant errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For specific models, we can use tailored algorithms to improve efficiency and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we introduce **Euler equation-based methods**: **time iteration** and **endogenous grid point methods**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Their main advantages are higher speed and accuracy. While precision wasn't a major focus when solving the optimal savings model, when we consider general equilibrium, where a Walrasian auctioneer determines market prices, having well-behaved supply and demand curves becomes essential. These methods make solving general equilibrium models more feasible.  \n",
    "(Note: Of course, applying each agent’s Bellman equation can form a recursive competitive equilibrium, which we will use to solve competitive equilibrium models in future lectures with the Bewley model.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to lectures 2:\n",
    "- First, we will theoretically prove that **Euler equation-based methods yield a unique fixed point for the policy function**.\n",
    "- Second, we will show that the **Bellman operator and the operator of the Euler equation-based method** commute at a certain bijection, meaning they **have the same solution**.  \n",
    "    (The application of these algorithms will be covered in the next lecture.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these concepts, we will consider a relatively simple **optimal growth model**, assuming TFP follows an i.i.d. distribution each period, and capital lasts for only one period.\n"
